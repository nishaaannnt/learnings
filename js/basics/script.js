/*
CALL STACK - js actually works due to this

1. call stack executes js codes
2. executes line by line
3. doesn't wait for anything, waits for none

--------------------------------------------------

BROWSER -> Has WebAPIs 

1. setTimeout
2. setInterval
3. fetch
4. Promises

these are all part of WebAPIs not JS
