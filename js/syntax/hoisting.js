/* HOISTING - variables and functions are hoisted

i.e you can use var and functions before declaration
but var will be undefined till then

Globaal execution context ->


as js is interpreted - 

1. Memory Phase - Variables are loaded/initialized (initial values undefined set kardeta hai)
2. Code Phase (Takes values from memory and executes)


memory phase loads all variables in the root level starting from undefined then to that as per their declaration

code phase takes context from memory and executes them
