Certainly! Below is a simple example demonstrating how to set up **LangChain** with **FastAPI** in Python. This example will showcase a document summarizer that:
1. Breaks down a document into chunks.
2. Generates embeddings for each chunk.
3. Uses LangChain to find relevant information based on a user’s question.

### Prerequisites

First, install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn langchain openai chromadb
```

> **Note**: Make sure to replace `openai` and `chromadb` with the vector store or LLM provider you’re using if different.

### 1. Setting Up LangChain in FastAPI

This example sets up a FastAPI app where users can upload documents and ask questions about the content.

1. **Create embeddings** for document chunks.
2. **Store embeddings** in a vector database (using `chromadb` in this example).
3. **Query relevant chunks** based on a user’s question and fetch responses from the LLM.

### Code Implementation

#### `main.py`

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, UploadFile, Form, HTTPException
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

# Initialize FastAPI app
app = FastAPI()

# Set up OpenAI embedding and LLM API key
openai_api_key = "your_openai_api_key"  # Replace with your OpenAI API key
embedding_model = OpenAIEmbeddings(openai_api_key=openai_api_key)
llm = OpenAI(api_key=openai_api_key)

# Set up vector store with Chroma (as a local vector database)
vectorstore = Chroma(embedding_function=embedding_model)

# Define the text splitter for chunking large documents
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=50)

@app.post("/upload_document/")
async def upload_document(file: UploadFile):
    """
    Endpoint to upload a document and save embeddings.
    """
    # Read file content and decode
    file_content = await file.read()
    document_text = file_content.decode("utf-8")
    
    # Split text into smaller chunks
    chunks = text_splitter.split_text(document_text)
    
    # Generate embeddings for each chunk and store in vector database
    vectorstore.add_texts(chunks)
    
    return {"message": "Document uploaded and processed successfully.", "chunks_count": len(chunks)}

@app.post("/ask_question/")
async def ask_question(question: str = Form(...)):
    """
    Endpoint to ask questions based on the document content.
    """
    if not vectorstore:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="No document has been uploaded yet.")
    
    # Initialize LangChain RetrievalQA chain with LLM and vectorstore
    qa_chain = RetrievalQA(llm=llm, retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever())
    
    # Pass the question to the chain to get an answer
    answer = qa_chain.run(question)
    
    return {"question": question, "answer": answer}

```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Setup and Configuration**:
   - **FastAPI**: Initializes a FastAPI app with two endpoints: `upload_document` and `ask_question`.
   - **OpenAI Embeddings and LLM**: Configures OpenAI’s `Embeddings` and LLMs via API key.
   - **Chroma Vector Store**: Sets up Chroma as the local vector database to store embeddings.
   - **Text Splitter**: The `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` breaks down large text into manageable chunks (each 500 characters with a 50-character overlap).

2. **`upload_document` Endpoint**:
   - Accepts a document upload (`UploadFile`).
   - Reads and decodes the file content.
   - Splits the document into smaller chunks and generates embeddings for each chunk.
   - Stores the embeddings in the vector store (`Chroma`).

3. **`ask_question` Endpoint**:
   - Accepts a question from the user.
   - Sets up a `RetrievalQA` chain in LangChain to query the vector database.
   - Finds the most relevant document chunks and generates an answer using the LLM.
   
### Running the FastAPI Server

To run the server, use:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### Testing the API

1. **Upload Document**: Send a POST request to `/upload_document` with a text file.
2. **Ask Question**: Send a POST request to `/ask_question` with a `question` in the form data.

### Example Workflow

1. **Upload a Document**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/upload_document/" -F "file=@your_document.txt"
   ```

2. **Ask a Question**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/ask_question/" -F "question=What is this document about?"
   ```

### Additional Tips

- **Error Handling**: Consider adding checks to ensure a document has been uploaded before allowing questions.
- **Multiple LLMs**: With LangChain, you can configure multiple LLMs by adding additional providers (e.g., Google’s Gemini or other APIs).
- **Storage Options**: For larger applications, consider using a persistent vector store like Pinecone or PGVector instead of a local `Chroma` instance.

This setup provides a simple, efficient way to summarize and query large documents while minimizing costs and optimizing performance. LangChain’s built-in tools, such as text splitting and vector database management, make this process straightforward, allowing developers to focus on the core application logic rather than handling complex LLM operations manually.
